# expressDemo
## A project that explores the functionality and use of express.JS to create back-end elements.

This is just a simple example of the different use cases of express.JS when creating the back-end, using a CRS architecture[at this moment.] 
so we can test out Postman's functionalities too in the same time.

## Controller - Used to transit data between requests and responses.
## Service - Used to do the logic for the requests.
## Model - Used, in this case, to store data.
## Router - Used to route requests towards the corresponding treatment service.

.env.example - gives an example of the environment variables.
